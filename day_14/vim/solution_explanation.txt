To replicate the solution:

$ base64 -d encoded_solution -o solution

(Why encoded? Because there's control characters that are non-printable otherwise.)

$ vi input.txt -s solution

- To improve speed, remove the `:redraw<CR>` command, and remove the `zz`.
- To see the action happening in slow-mo, add `:set writedelay=2`
  after the first tab is closed.
- This runs a lot better on Vi/Vim than NeoVim.

----

:%sort

    - Sort all lines in the file.

dd

    - Delete a line.

:g/\(^.\+\)\n\1\+/d _

    - It's a global command (see :h :g) used to delete duplicate
      lines.
    - \(^.\+\)\n\1\+ is saying: "match a line with one or more of
      anything, and capture it so that it can be referenced later
      on", and then \1\+ is used to reference whatever was matched
      already one or more times.
    - d _ to delete all the matches into a black hole (don't put
      it in a register).
    - Overall, this will get rid of duplicated lines throughout a
      file, but it only works if the lines are sorted.

:%s/ \d\+,\d\+ /&->&/g

    - Substitute command used to duplicate the match.
    - % is a shortcut for a range that says, "The whole buffer".
    - \d\+ means one or more digits.
    - & inside the replacement portion of :substitute is a
      reference to the entire matched portion (AKA \0).
    - The g flag makes the match apply to more than just the first
      match on each line.

:%s/\n/\r\r

    - Substitute command used to add an empty line after each line.
    - You must use \n within the match portion, but \r within the
      replacement portion.

:tabed drawing
:set nowrap
:set nu
:set ve=all
:set maxfuncdepth=500

    - Create a new tab named, "drawing".
    - :set nowrap to make it so that long lines don't wrap, but
      instead have the screen scroll to the right.
    - :set nu to turn on line numbers.
    - :set ve=all to make it so that the cursor can go where there
      are no characters (See :h virtualedit).
    - :set maxfuncdepth=500 to prepare for a very recursive
      macro. Vim will only let you go so deep by default.

yy200PgtGdddd:nohl<CR>

    - yy200P to create 200 empty lines.
    - gt to switch to the other tab.
    - dddd to delete a a couple lines.
    - :nohl to stop highlighting the matches.

gg0qq"ayiw2w"byiw2w"cyiw2w"dyiwgt:@b<CR>

    - gg to move to the top of the file.
    - 0 to ensure cursor is at the beginning of the line.
    - qq to begin recording a macro (into the named register q).
    - "ayiw to yank the "inner word" into the named register, a
      (see :h yank, :h iw).
    - 2w to move two "words" to the right (see :h :word).
    - "byiw same as before, but into the named register, b.
    - "cyiw same as before, but into the named register, c.
    - "dyiw same as before, but into the named register, d.
    - gt to switch tabs.
    - :@b<CR> to move the cursor to the line number specified by
      the value in register b (<CR> means the ENTER key).

@a|ma:@d<CR>

    - @a| to move the cursor to the column specified by the value
      stored in register a.
    - ma to set a mark, identified by a.
    - :@d<CR> to move the cursor to the line number specified by
      the value in register d (<CR> means the ENTER key).

@c|<c-v>`ar█gt2wq999@q:q!<CR>

    - @c| to move the cursor to the column specified by the value
      stored in the register c.
    - <c-v> to enter VISUAL BLOCK mode.
    - `a to move the cursor to "a" mark. ` is used rather than '
      because ` will respect both column and row location.
    - rx to replace replace the selected region with x's.
    - gt to switch tabs.
    - 2w to move two "words" forward".
    - q to quit recording the macro.
    - 9999@q to replay the macro 9999 times.
    - :q!<CR> to close the current tab.

G?█<CR>

    - G to move to the bottom of the file
    - ?█ to search for the previous █ character.

jdG

    - j to move down.
    - dG to delete until the end of the file

gg500|ro

    - gg to go to the top of the file.
    - 500| to move the cursor to the 500th column.
    - ro to write a "o" where the cursor is.

qqqqqmaj<c-v>"ayh<c-v>"by2l<c-v>"cy`a:redraw<CR>

    - qq to begin recording a macro to the q register.
    - ma to set a mark identified by "a".
    - j to move the cursor down one row.
    - <c-v>"ayh to enter VISUAL BLOCK mode and yank the selection
      (a single character) into the "a" register, and then move
      the cursor one column to the left.
    - <c-v>"by2l to do the same thing as above, but into the "b"
      register, and then move two columns to the right.
    - <c-v>"cy`a ... same thing, but into the "c" register, and
      then move the cursor back to the column and row where the
      "a" mark was placed.
    - :redraw because NeoVim crashes without it.

zz

    - zz to center the viewport on the cursor.

:exe @a == ' ' ? 'norm r jro@q' : @b == ' ' ? 'norm r jhro@q' : @c == ' ' ? 'norm r jlro@q' : 'norm gg500|ro'

    - :exe to evaluate an expression. This expression is a nested
      ternary in this case (see :h :exe, :h ternary).
    - @a == ' ' ? 'norm r jro@q' : ... is a ternary expression.
      If the value in register "a" is an empty space, then the
      norm command is executed, otherwise another ternary is
      executed (see subsequent steps for explanation). "norm" is
      used to execute normal mode commands (see :h norm). In this
      case, r<space> runs first to replace the cell underneath the
      cursor with a space. Next jroq will move the cursor down one
      row, replace the cell with a "o". Finally @q will replay
      the macro once.
    - @b == ' ' ? 'norm r jhro@q' : ... is much like the first
      ternary, but the normal command executes something slightly
      different. jh moves the cursor down and left. ro replaces
      the cell with an "o". @q replays the macro.
    - Not going to explain the rest of the expression, but the
      general idea is that most cases result in recursively
      replaying the macro.

q900@q

    - q to stop recording.
    - 900@q to replay the macro up to 900 times.

:1,$-s/o//gn

    - Substitute command to count the number of o's from the top
      of the file until the last line, minus one.
    - g makes the operation apply to more than just the first
      match on each line.
    - n is a flag that makes it so the action is only reported
      as a message -- no changes to the buffer are made.

dGi<c-r>=execute('1messages')<CR><ESC>

    - dG to delete up until (and including) the last line.
    - <c-r>= to enter the expression register.
    - execute('1messages')<CR> to get the last message into the
      current buffer. The last message should be the one that has
      how many matches were found from the last substitute command.
    - <ESC> to leave INSERT mode.

:s/\(\d\+\) matches.*/\1

    - Substitute command that is used to replace
      "N matches on M lines" with just the N value.
    - \(...\) is a capture group, so that the part inside can be
      referenced in the replacement part of the :s command.

kdggd0

    - k to move up.
    - dgg to delete from the current position until the top of
      the file.
    - 0 to move to the start of the line.
